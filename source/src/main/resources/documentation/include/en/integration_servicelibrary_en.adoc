A service is a Cerberus entity that carries all the information necessary to :

* perform HTTP actions (GET,POST...)
* perform SOAP calls
* perform FTP actions
* Interact with Apache Kafka topics

=== Service Type

There are four service type :

* SOAP : for SOAP endpoints
* REST : for REST endpoints
* FTP : interact with files in a distant folder
* KAFKA : for Apache Kafka Topics

==== KAFKA

In Cerberus, you can :

* produce an event to a topic
* search for an event in a topic

Choosing Kafka service type will add 4 new fields to the service : Topic, Key, Filter Path, Filter Value

===== PRODUCE

Producing an event is pretty easy. Additionaly to the others topics, you must fill topic and key in.

===== SEARCH

Searching an event will always return all the events generated during the execution and after its beginning.
Additionaly to the others topics, you must fill topic and key in. You can also filters the list of events found.

The best practise is to produce an event with a functionnal key unique to cerberus (e.g. 'cerberus%system.EXECUTIONID%') that will be persisted in every topics and filters on that key to be able to perform controls on it.

Example

The results will be stored in the Cerberus elements (as it is done for SOAP/REST resposne) and filtered will all the elements matching the filter path = value.

If you want to have multiples conditions, you stack all your condition in JSON in the filter path and set the last one into the value field like this
