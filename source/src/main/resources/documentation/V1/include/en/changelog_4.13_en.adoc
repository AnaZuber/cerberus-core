* Event Hooks implementation allowing to configure any action attached a list of supported events (9) : CAMPAIGN_START, CAMPAIGN_END, CAMPAIGN_END_CIKO, EXECUTION_START, EXECUTION_END, EXECUTION_END_LASTRETRY, TESTCASE_CREATE, TESTCASE_UPDATE, TESTCASE_DELETE
* 5 connectors can be used to those events : EMAIL, SLACK, TEAMS, GOOGLE-CHAT, GENERIC. When event occurs, Cerberus will notify the chosen associated system in a native format using those connectors. That allow an easier integration of Cerberus to any external tool. New connectors can also be implemented in a much easier way.
