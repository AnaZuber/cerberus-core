*Improvements / New features*
[square]
* Event Hook implementation allowing to configure any actions attached a list of supported events : CAMPAIGN_START, CAMPAIGN_END, CAMPAIGN_END_CIKO, EXECUTION_START, EXECUTION_END, EXECUTION_END_LASTRETRY, TESTCASE_CREATE, TESTCASE_UPDATE, TESTCASE_DELETE
* 5 connectors can be attached to those events : EMAIL, SLACK, TEAMS, GOOGLE-CHAT, GENERIC. Events can not notify any event externaly to Cerberus using any of those connectors. That allow an easier integration of Cerberus to any external tool. New connectors can now be implemented in a much easier way.
* New version of GetTagDetails (V002) with more information on extracted Tag data (using the same public JSON format than the one used on the GENERIC connector).

*Warning to be considered before applying the version (deprecated features)*
