* Fixed JSON parsing on float values #2282.

*Improvements / New features*
[square]
* Event Hooks implementation allowing to configure any action attached a list of supported events (9) : CAMPAIGN_START, CAMPAIGN_END, CAMPAIGN_END_CIKO, EXECUTION_START, EXECUTION_END, EXECUTION_END_LASTRETRY, TESTCASE_CREATE, TESTCASE_UPDATE, TESTCASE_DELETE
* 5 connectors can be used to those events : EMAIL, SLACK, TEAMS, GOOGLE-CHAT, GENERIC. When event occurs, Cerberus will notify the chosen associated system in a native format using those connectors. That allow an easier integration of Cerberus to any external tool. New connectors can also be implemented in a much easier way.
* New version of GetTagDetails (V002) with more information on extracted Tag data (using the same public JSON format than the one used on the GENERIC event hook connector).

*Warning to be considered before applying the version (deprecated features)*
