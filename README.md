# What is it?

Cerberus is a lowcode automated testing tool that support Web, IOS, Android and API connectors.
The tool allow to create some automated testcases via an ergonomic web interface without any need for developpment skills. Automated test management now become available for all your projet, quality and business teams.

All your applications, whether they are API based (REST, SOAP and KAFKA) or web (via Selenium) or even IOS and Android (via Appium) can be tested via Cerberus Web interface.

Group and organize your testcases inside campaigns, shcedule them or trigger them inside CICD pipes via Jenkins or Gitlab connectors and receive notifications via email or slack.
