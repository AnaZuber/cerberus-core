# What is it?

Cerberus Testing is a low-code test automation platform that supports testing Web, iOS, Android and API (REST, SOAP and Kafka) applications.

The platform allows the creation of automated testcases through an easy to use web interface without any need for development skills - automated tests implementation and management now becomes available for all elements of the development, quality and business teams.

Group and organize your testcases in campaigns, schedule them or trigger them in CI/CD pipelines through Jenkins/Gitlab/Bitbucket connectors and receive notifications by email or Slack.

Once installed, and in few clicks, get your automated tests up and running in order to either secure your software quality before it is deployed to production or to continuously monitor that the quality in production is maintained.
